# Hotel Booking System

The hotel booking system is a web application that handles the room bookings of customers for any hotel. There is an option to choose from wide range of rooms like standard, suite, deluxe etc. This is also flexible in the type if IDs required for any guest (in this application addressed as customers), they can choose to provide any ID from the list of accepted identity types. The other obvious features in such a system are the features of room availability and making a booking for the customers as per the availability.
The intended user communities of this application will be the administration of the hotel along with the managers and the receptionist (each of their roles will be explained further). The administrative user will have the ability to create room types, ID types accepted and room options in the hotel. The manager can add customers by verifying their ID, create availability of rooms and bookings for customers. The receptionist will only be able to view all features that will assist them in successfully checking in and out the customers to their hotel.
